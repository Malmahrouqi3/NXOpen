# GTSC NXOpen Resources
# Description of Files

- ``Expressions.py``:  Currently, formats and writes expression files (.exp) as well as .txt files to reference the name of expressions.
    1) format_exp (Name, Type, Formula, Unit)      Arranges expressions in a manner recognizably by NX.
    2) write_exp_file (Input, FileName)      Writes the expression file from a list of strings. In NX, go to Expressions>>Import Expressions>>Open .exp file.
    3) write_txt_file (Input, FileName)      Writes the expression file with only the names of expressions.
- ``Read_Dat.py``:       
    1) Read_Dat (Filename):    Reads dat files such that the return will be a (:,2) or (:,3) set of points.

- ``cst_para.py``:                2D & 3D CST Paramaterization. Recommended to use 2d feature, since 3D is quite complex and requires 3 lists of weights - meaning it will take forever to estimate those weights and generating the model is not simple.
    1) def cst(w):               Pass in coeff for the suction or pressure surface, as it will return (x,y) points - where x is half-consine linspace and y is generated by cst paramterization.

- ``Airfoil.py``:       Provides shortcuts to generate aifoils and any airfoil-shaped components.
